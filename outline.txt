IGN is one of the most reliable resources for game news.
anytime I want to look up something in the gaming community Its nice to know I can just add ign to my search and get reliable information.
I often use IGN to get information on upcoming games, to look up reviews or the occasional walk-through when I get stuck. 

I started coding a couple years ago and over the last year I've been learning about web-development. Video games and web-development are two of my greatest passions and working at IGN would be the perfect combination of those two. 
It would be an amazing learning oppertunity and really help propell my development career. I would love to be apart of ign and help contribute to the growing community of IGN.

I've aready learned from the initial projects so thank you for doing this program and taking the time to review my submission it means a lot to me.
