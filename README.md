My codeFoo9 submission

Hi I am Devon Mires. My video submission and information about me is on my website mires.dev/CodeFoo9 for you to view.
I chose to create a webpage for my submission because the requirements said this section could
be done in whatever format you feel most comfortable with, and doing a video as well as text seemed like a good fit for me.
Doing a webpage allowed for this and I thought was a fun way to do the project.

The answer to the second requirement can be found in portfolio/CodeFoo9/problem2/. 
The JS file has the math for the problem in code while the html displays my thought process.

The answer to the third requirement can be found in portfolio/CodeFoo9/problem3/.
I used JS to solve the problem and the index.html file displays the result. My rational is explained in JS file as comments.

For the fourth section I chose to do the front end option because that is what I am most familiar with. This can be found in portfolio/CodeFoo9/FrontEnd
