		<p>The formula to figure out how many spheres could fit in a container is (filled space)/(volume of sphere)

where filled space is equal to (container volume) * (packing density)

Because there will be empty space between each pokeball you need to figure out the empty space and the filled space.

In geometry sphere packing refers to an arrangement of spheres in a 3 dimensional space. Typically if the spheres are equal in size and packed densly there will be 26% of empty space.

So the filled space of the tower is only 74% percent so it has a packing density of 0.74.

If a stored pokeball is about the size of a golfball then a pokeball radius is equall to 0.84 inches.</p>

<h1>Front End project</h1>
<div class="coit">
	<div><p>
This is my front end solution. I followed the design as well as I could. I used fontawesome to match the icons closely. Not all content contained a thumbnail so I used placeholder images where necessary. If you click on the titles or images it will send you to the article or video on IGN's site! I noticed in most cases the urls for articles on your site are just the content type, date, and titles of the content. So using regexps I changed the titles into url links. This does not work with all of them, because not every url follows this naming convention. I'm very excited for you to see my work so please feel free to check it out and give constructive feedback! Thank You!</p>
